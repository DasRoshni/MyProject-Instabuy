# instabuy

Trello board: https://trello.com/b/q6eXobXn/instabuy

Many of us (including myself) are indecisive of choosing the dish/cuisine we want to eat at an eatery.
We typically engage in atleast a 3 step-process to search for the food we want to eat.

Step 1: Sign in to Yelp/ Zomato
Step 2: Filter on restaurant/cuisine
Step 3: Check for reviews

And repeat...until the Voila! moment.

After all 3 steps, we are yet to decide on the dish after reaching the restaurant.

On 'Instabuy', users can decide on 'What-to-Eat' based on food pictures uploaded by other users and reviews provided by them.
Instead of choosing the dish based on the restaurant, we give the freedom to users to choose the restaurant based on the dish they find tempting.

Services  Implemented Include:
-Google sign-in
-Theme creation and display
-Theme subscription
-Report creation and display i.e. input and display of dish and restaurant details, reviews and associating a picture upload with it.

-Cron jobs for regular subscription e-mails to users.
